         <p> 
          <h4>What is HEIRLOOM Painting?</h4>
         </p>
         <p style="font-weight:500">
            Our “Heirloom Painting” process is a system of sanding and preparing the surfaces that will remove the 
            brush and roller marks from previous applications.  This is accomplished by using a HEPAA certified dust extraction 
            system and special sanding equipment which captures 98% of the dust generated during the sanding process.  
            Drywall repairs are also sanded with the same results, and with virtually no dust residue.  
         </p>
         <p style="font-weight:500"> 
            We are the difference between applying new color to a surface and applying a new finish to the same surface.  
            A value added benefit that is realized by this process is that once the surfaces have been prepared and finished 
            using this Heirloom method, it is likely that the  next time a color change is desired, preparation sanding 
            will not be needed. This saves you $$$ and maintains a quality finished surface.  
            <button style="font-weight:600" onClick="myhideFunction()"> click for more details...</button>
         </p>
         <div id="moreText">
           <p>
            Each time a surface gets painted, the brush and roller texture left will amplify with each coat applied.  
            During the third coat of finishing, the surfaces will have the appearance of <span style="font-style:italic">“orange peel”</span> effect.  
            You will notice that the areas that have been patched, such as holes and dents in the wall surface appear 
            to have a smooth and flat texture, while the surrounding area has the rough <span style="font-style:italic">“orange peel”</span>.  
            You may also notice that the rough surface of the walls will catch and hold dust that is visible 
            when the sun shines into the room, so much so that you now have cobb webs forming on the wall, 
            especially near the ceiling or near fans.
         </p>
           <p>  
            If you have Millwork that is original to your home that has many layers of paint applied over the years, 
            you will notice that the edges are now rounded over from the many layers of paint.  
            We can resurface this original millwork to restore the original line crispness and flat surface qualities.

            The pictures below shows our recent project. The customer had two growing daughters who each needed their own area in the bathroom to get ready for school.  The single sink was replaced with a double vanity and sink combination.  The plumbing was all reconfigured to create two separate water sources. Lighting and mirrors were also reconfigured to meet the customer’s needs.
